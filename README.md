# Project Name: **Decentralized Identity Verification**

## Who am I:
**Name:** Bhawna Anand   
**Project:** Decentralized Digital Identity Verification using Web3 technologies.

## Project Details:
This project leverages blockchain and the Andromeda Protocol to build a decentralized digital identity system. Users can create a self-sovereign identity (SSI) that they control and use for secure, verifiable authentication. This system eliminates the need for centralized authorities, ensuring privacy and security in identity management.

## Vision:
The vision of this project is to revolutionize online identity verification by creating a secure, user-controlled solution that removes the risks associated with centralized identity databases. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, this system promotes privacy, accessibility, and efficiency in digital identity management.
